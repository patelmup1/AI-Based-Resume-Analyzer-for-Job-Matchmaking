# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Resume Analyzer & Job Matchmaking System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In todayâ€™s job market, candidates often submit generic resumes that donâ€™t align well with specific job roles. Meanwhile, recruiters struggle with the time-consuming task of manually screening applications.

This project provides an **AI-powered Resume Analyzer** that automates resume parsing, matches resumes with job descriptions, and offers **smart suggestions** to optimize hiring for both candidates and employers.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Parse and analyze resumes using NLP techniques
- Match resume content against job descriptions using AI models
- Generate a job-match score based on keyword and semantic relevance
- Provide actionable suggestions for resume improvement using LLMs

## ðŸ§  AI/ML Components Used

| Component              | Technology / Model                  | Purpose                                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Resume Parsing         | `spaCy` (en_core_web_sm)            | Extract structured data from resumes   |
| Keyword Matching       | `TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity`        | Measure keyword relevance              |
| Semantic Matching      | `Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)`  | Understand context beyond keywords     |
| Resume Suggestions     | `Mistral-7B-Instruct` (LLM)         | Generate personalized feedback         |
| Experience Extraction  | Regex (upgradeable to ML)           | Detect mentions of experience duration |
| Skill Extraction       | Rule-based (upgradeable to NER)     | Identify technical and soft skills     |
| Visualization          | Streamlit / Plotly                  | Display insights & match score         |
